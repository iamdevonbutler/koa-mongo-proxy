- multiple database instances
- refactor index.js
- pref test.
- test time implementation
- perf test _isType() in utils
- add is NAN to utils
- debugger when tests fail.....
- might be able to cache the deconstruction...
- pre-push live search console.logs
- perf test values, array of values, array of objects.
- perf testing: deconstruction and reconstruction inc slowness by around 10% and validate methods inc slowness by 5-9%, novalidate adds around 3-4% given 50,000 requests in series.
- maybe there should be a global error handler and a collection error handler.
- make more ES6y
- preprocess 194 debug statement - say something about that in docs.
- could replace OOP validator w/ functional validator. -  find out how costly obj construction is in JS
- travis should dl mongo 6.0 not ^6.0
- might be double wrapping promises - db.users.remove is a promise to begin w/.
- there might be a babel bug or some bug that occurs when trying to use es6 import syntax to import db from 'mongorules'.
- do i need error.prototype (see error file)
- does close() return a promise.
