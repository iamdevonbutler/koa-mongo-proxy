- multiple database instances
- refactor index.js
- pref test.
- test time implementation
- perf test _isType() in utils
- add is NAN to utils
- debugger when tests fail.....
- might be able to cache the deconstruction...
- pre-push live search console.logs
- perf test values, array of values, array of objects.
- perf testing: deconstruction and reconstruction inc slowness by around 10% and validate methods inc slowness by 5-9%, novalidate adds around 3-4% given 50,000 requests in series.
- maybe there should be a global error handler and a collection error handler.
- make more ES6y
