- seems like the constructor params for payload update and payload are a bit messed up. too much isUpsert and isSetOperation
- docs
  - mention that this is for microservices and a deisgn paradigm of multiple db connections to a distributed cluser of datastores.
  - defaultDb docs

Phase II
- architecture docs
- validate not null should be an array field, so that we can validate the outer array as not null, and inner items as not null.
- add gh questions that are answered to a FAQ doc.
- add custom types
- add email type
- custom transform properties for schema.
- custom denyXss function, custom timestamp validator - maybe make all type checks customizeable.
- grep '@todo'
- add other transform/validate properties to schema.
- allow for custom sanitize func
- donate to project
- pretty up errors.
- pre-push live search console.logs
- think about error codes
  - empty payload is 0
  - validation error is 1
  - mongodb error is 2


Questions
- should there be a notification of you are operating on a model that does not exist.
- how to insert types such as NumberLong (https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query/type/)
- see if query modifiers work w/ cursors (https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query-modifier/)
- find out minimun mongo version this works w/.
- should we keep the return error from handleErrors thing or could it cause bugs.
- should we give more meta info to custom validate and transform. transform might find it helpful if it knew that this was a update as opposed to an insert.
- should we notify the user when they are using an unsupported update operation such as $pull;
