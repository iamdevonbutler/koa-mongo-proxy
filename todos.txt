- there are types of shell methods. make sure databse methods work and are mentioned in docs.
- arrayofvalues inside an arrayofobjects tests
- in docs mention that this is for microservices and a deisgn paradigm of multiple db connections to a distributed cluser of datastores.
- seems like the constructor params for payload update and payload are a bit messed up. too much isUpsert and isSetOperation
- validate type is kinda weird for arrays. it does the outside and inside in the same go. test well for addtoset and else.
- test - an array update op that we dont cover to see if it works.
- give more meta info to custom validate and transform. transform might find it helpful if it knew that this was a update as opposed to an insert.
- test type validation for array of values. make sure types are checked for inner and outer.
- validate not null should be an array so that we can validate the outer array as not null, and inner items as not null.
- make sure we are filtering nulls from arrays.
- what happens when u run a random method that isnt insert/update/... and theres a success and when the is a failure/
- do type validation using the new syntax. we should be validating multi type fileds propertly.
- make a list of all the operations from docs and make sure i have tests for all of them.
   - e.g. $.thisandthat
- see if $explain works (https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/meta/explain/#metaOp._S_explain)
- defaultDb docs
- test removeModel and removeModels. add tests. in readme mention use cases for these (really edge case - if your api has a update hook you can change your models w/o taking the server down).
- verify im doing dates right and _id.
- should see what this is like when a model has no scheam and has model methods only.
- getDatabase should always return a proxy - elims errors where people may pass in a third param by accident, and if someone wants a unproxied obj they can call getConnection and then conn.db()
- addModel should have more checks to ensure people are passing in a schema.
- idk if _getModel (should be getModels) should throw.
- test time implementation
- sanitize changes date from obj to string (will cause bugs)
- add @file declarations
- what happens when you try to do shit w/o calling addDatabase
- mention in docs that results from add/get database return a proxy, but u can get the naked (unproxied) connectino obj from getConnection
- reversing no validate - going to be the first param so u can query a - change docs.
- gotta test unique indexes - pref an upsert after doing a unique index and it should error (https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/core/index-unique/#index-type-unique)
- test mixed types w/ integration test.


Phase II
- architecture docs
- add gh questions that are answered to a FAQ doc.
- add custom types
- add email type
- custom transform properties for schema.
- custom denyXss function, custom timestamp validator - maybe make all type checks customizeable.
- grep '@todo'
- add other transform/validate properties to schema.
- allow for custom sanitize func
- donate to project
- pretty up errors.
- pre-push live search console.logs
- think about error codes
  - empty payload is 0
  - validation error is 1
  - mongodb error is 2


Questions
- should there be a notification of you are operating on a model that does not exist.
- how to insert types such as NumberLong (https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query/type/)
- see if query modifiers work w/ cursors (https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query-modifier/)
- find out minimun mongo version this works w/.
- should we keep the return error from handleErrors thing or could it cause bugs.
